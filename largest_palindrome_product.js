//Largest Palindrom Product

//A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The 
//largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit 
//numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99. Find the largest palindrome 
//made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.


//Solved 3/04/2020
//
//Notes: This problem was relatively easy. Much easier than
//the last. This may not be the fastest solution but I tried
//to make sure there weren't any unnecessary double calculations.
//This was also the first time I gave myself a time limit to work
//on the problem. This took me 24 minutes 30 seconds of 25 minutes.
//I was under time, but I feel I could have finished faster had I taken
//the time to work out the edge cases initially. 
//
//This program finds the largest palindrome resulting from the 
//product of two n digit numbers.
