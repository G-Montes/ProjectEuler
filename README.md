# ProjectEuler
My attempts at creating generalized solutions for the problems from projecteuler.net 


This repository will include my successful attempts at solving problems from the website. The goal is to complete a problem every day, starting from problem 1 without skipping. Although the initial problems will be solved using JavaScript, I'm not limiting the languages that I can use. This was inspired by a post on freecodecamp.org that mentioned the #ProjectEuler100 challenge.

I will include my first working solution as the original file. If I make any changes that offer a substantial time or space save, or take a different approach than the original, then i will include it as a separate file. The file will have the same name, with \_vn appended at the end, where n is the solution number.

My hopes with this are to challenge myself to think creatively and push myself to try and code everyday. Sometimes working on larger projects can be a bit draining. Either the project completion can seem far away or you encounter an issue that takes a long time to solve and prevents progress. As I complete more of these problems, I can hopefully look back at this and motivate myself to continue pursuing solutions.
